# Google Cloud Web Server Deployment

---

This project shows how I set up a basic web server using Google Cloud.

## What I Did
- Created a free Google Cloud account
- Made a virtual machine (VM) using Compute Engine
- Connected to the VM using SSH
- Installed Apache (or Nginx) to serve a webpage
- Viewed the “Hello World” page in my browser

## Commands I Used
These are the commands I ran inside the VM to install the web server:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y

## What I Learned
- How to create and connect to a cloud VM
- How to install and run a web server
- How to expose a service to the internet
- How to document a cloud project on GitHub
